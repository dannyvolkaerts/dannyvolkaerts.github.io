# Introduction to Data Science

Data Science is the interdisciplinary field that combines **statistics**, **programming**, and **domain knowledge** to extract meaningful insights from data. It bridges the gap between raw data and actionable knowledge.

## Importance

Data Science enables organizations to make **data-driven decisions**, improving efficiency, accuracy, and innovation. From predicting customer behavior to optimizing healthcare outcomes, its applications are transformative.

## Definition

Data Science = 📊 Statistics + 💻 Programming + 🌍 Domain Knowledge

### Comparison with related fields:

- 📈 **Data Analytics**: Focuses on analyzing historical data
- 🧑‍🔬 **Data Science**: Includes predictive modeling and machine learning
- ⚙️ **Machine Learning**: Subset of AI focused on algorithms
- 🤖 **AI**: Broader field including robotics and natural language processing

#### Importance of data-driven decisions:

Data Science empowers organizations to make informed decisions, reducing risks and uncovering opportunities.

## Why Data Science Matters

### Data explosion:

From kilobytes to zettabytes, the world is generating data at an unprecedented rate.

### Applications:

- **Business**: Netflix recommendation system
- **Healthcare**: Smart (personal) diabetes assistant advising persons with type 1 diabetes on insulin administration in specific cases
- **Sports**: Soccer field tactics optimization for a specific opponent

*Where have you seen data science in action?*


## Core Components & Tools

### Key skills:

- **Statistics**: Both for data understanding and the backbone of many machine learning algorithms
- **Programming**: The process of writing code to create software applications, automate tasks, and solve problems
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis or machine learning

### Tools:

- **Programming**: R, Python,...
- **Machine Learning libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, tidymodels,...
- **Visualization libraries**: ggplot2, Matplotlib,...
- **Databases**: SQL, MongoDB,...
- **Data Science Platforms**: Kaggle, Google Colab,...

## Data Science Workflow

### Steps:

1. **Problem Definition**
2. **Data Collection**
3. **Data Cleaning**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Model Building**
6. **Evaluation**
7. **Deployment**

*Use the crisp data mining lifecycle diagram or flowchart to illustrate the iterative and non-linear nature of the process.*

### Example Using R with the Pokémon Dataset

#### Problem definition

> Can we predict the pokemon type of a pokemon based on its battle specifications?\

First, we need to talk to domain experts (pokemon trainers, professor Oak,..) to know what the pokemon type is, and how this is related to the respective pokemon battle specifications. A data science project can only be successful if you have enough domain expertise involved in the project (either gathered by yourself as a data scientist or by consulting domain experts).\
After consulting, we know that pokemon can have two types and that the type of a pokemon is mostly represented in the weakness and strengths against other pokemon types, and not so much in the numerical statistics (defense, attack,..).\

Having this info, we need to ask for clarification on the 'predict the pokemon type'. We need to predict the type1 of a pokemon.\

Let's investigate!

#### Data import
```{r, echo=FALSE}
renv::activate()
```

Let's first get data of Pokemon to know more about them.

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(readr)

# Define the raw URL of the GitHub Gist
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannyvolkaerts/something/refs/heads/main/pokemon_full.csv"

# Read CSV directly from the URL
pokemon_df <- read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows
head(pokemon_df)
``` 

You can see the first rows of our pokemon dataset? What do you see? There is no information on the 


#### Data Exploration

Using the Pokémon dataset, we can calculate summary statistics like average height and weight.

**Output:**

```
Average Height: 1.2 meters
Average Weight: 35.5 kilograms
```

#### Example 2: Top 5 Pokémon by Base Stats

**Output:**

```
1. Mewtwo
2. Dragonite
3. Tyranitar
4. Charizard
5. Garchomp
```

#### Example 3: Distribution of Pokémon Types

**Output:**

```
Water: 120
Fire: 80
Grass: 95
Electric: 70
Psychic: 60
```

These examples demonstrate how R can be used to analyze and visualize data effectively.
