    "text": "SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a foundational tool for anyone interested in data science. With the exponential growth of data in today’s digital world, being able to efficiently query, manipulate, and analyze this data is essential. SQL is the standard language for relational database management systems and allows users to interact with databases in a straightforward and efficient manner. Knowledge of SQL enables data profiles to extract meaningful insights from large datasets, perform data analysis, and feed data into their machine learning models. Understanding SQL opens up opportunities in data analysis, data engineering, and beyond, making it a critical skill for any aspiring data profile."
