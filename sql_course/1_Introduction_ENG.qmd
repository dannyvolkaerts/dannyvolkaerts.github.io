# Here we will use a sample Database called HR that manages the HR data of the small businesses which is collected from [www.sqltutorial.org](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/). And to create the database, a SQLite script file was used when rendering the document. Read the [extension docs](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/interactive-sql#using) for details.

## Introduction to SQL and Databases

---

### What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for dealing with relational databases. It can be used to insert, search, update, and delete database records.


- **Data Retrieval:** SQL allows you to query data, even complex datasets, in an efficient manner.
- **Data Manipulation:** Modify and manage the data as per analysis requirements.
- **Data Integrity:** Maintain the accuracy and reliability of the database.

---

### Relational Databases

- A relational database stores data in tables (or relations).
- Data is organized into rows and columns.
- Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL and SQLite.

---

### Key Concepts

- **Tables:** Store information in rows and columns.
- **Queries:** Retrieve or insert data based on specific criteria.
- **Schemas:** Define the structure of the database.
